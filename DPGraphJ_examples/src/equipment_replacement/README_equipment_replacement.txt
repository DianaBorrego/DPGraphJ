Equipment replacement problem.

The problem seeks to determine an optimal replacement policy for a single piece of equipment of age i over a time horizon of n units. We assume:

- The part can have, at most, a life of m years after which it can no longer be in use.
- The annual maintenance cost is c(i).
- The purchase price for a unit is t(i). Where t(0) is the price of (buying) a new unit and t(m) is the residual (selling) price at the end of its operating life.
- The initial age is e_0.
- At each time unit, the possible decisions are M, C (keep, change) consisting of keeping the part at the current instant if possible or changing it for a new one.
