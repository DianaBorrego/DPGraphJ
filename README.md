## Getting started with an example

For solving a Dynamic Programming problem, you have to implement some specific code. Let's go through the steps with the example of the *equipment replacement*, which is stated as follows: 

The problem seeks to determine an optimal replacement policy for a single piece of equipment of age *i* over a time horizon of *n* units. We assume:

- The part can have, at most, a life of *m* years after which it can no longer be in use.
- The annual maintenance cost is *c(i)*.
- The purchase price for a unit is *t(i)*. Where *t(0)* is the price of (buying) a new unit and *t(m)* is the residual (selling) price at the end of its operating life.
- The initial age is *e_0*.
- At each time unit, the possible decisions are *M*, *C* (keep, change) consisting of keeping the part at the current instant if possible or changing it for a new one.
